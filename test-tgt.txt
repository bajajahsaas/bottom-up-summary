Several of this Court's decisions reflect a developing appreciation of the injury that can be inflicted when a "disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected." Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 634 (1996). But whereas many of those cases required the Court to consider the interplay of gender and sexual orientation discrimination as a matter of constitutional doctrine, the case at hand presents a simple question of statutory construction. The issue presented here is whether Title VII's express statutory prohibition against discrimination "because of * * * sex" encompasses discrimination against someone because that person's sexual orientation or transgender status does not conform to traditional stereotypes for persons of that ascribed sex. This Court has already answered that question, in substance, when it held in cases like Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), and Los Angeles Department of Water & Power v. Man-7hart, 435 U.S. 702 (1978), that Title VII bars discrimination on the basis of sex stereotyping.In passing Title VII, "Congress made the simple but momentous announcement that sex, race, religion, and national origin" have no relevance "to the selection, evaluation, or compensation of employees." Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 239 (plurality opinion). Indeed, the statute facially reflects Congress' intent to bar employment decisions on the basis of sex. In now-familiar language, Title VII forbids an employer to "fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," or to "limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's * * * sex." 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)-(2) (emphases added).This prohibition embodies a "broad rule of workplace equality," Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 22 (1993), that "strike[s] at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment" based on sex, among other protected characteristics, Manhart, 435 U.S. at 707 n.13 (emphasis added), "regardless of whether the discrimination" targets "majorities or minorities," Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 71-72 (1977). Consistent with these broadly sweeping objectives, this Court has long held that sex discrimination unravels the fabric of American society by excluding people from participating in public and private life, and offends our8Nation's shared commitment to individual dignity by classifying people based on their sex rather than their individual qualities and attributes.Reading Title VII to prohibit discrimination on the basis of the stereotypes regarding sexual orientation and transgender status that society ascribes to individuals because of sex honors the express text of the statute as construed through decades of this Court's antidiscrimination jurisprudence. "[C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, [the] * * * judicial inquiry is complete." Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 461-462 (2002). In accordance with the text's plain meaning, people experience discrimination "because of * * * sex" when they have been treated differently than they would have been had their sex been different. If a person is fired because he is a man who loves a man but would not have been fired if he had been a woman who loves a man, that person has been discriminated against "because of * * * sex." If a person is fired for presenting and identifying as female, because the employer ascribes that person as male, but would not have been fired if the employer ascribed that person as female, the employee has been fired "because of * * * sex."This Court's precedent makes clear that this kind of "but for" discrimination lies at the heart of antidiscrimination protections. In the context of race, for example, the Court made clear that anti-miscegenation laws were a form of discrimination on the basis of race, notwithstanding their "equal application" to white and9black persons, because a law that "makes the color of a person's skin the test of whether his conduct is a criminal offense" is one that restricts rights "on account of race." Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1967). The Court has construed Title VII to employ a similar "but for" test. Manhart, 435 U.S. at 711. The acts challenged here easily qualify; they would not have been taken had the employee's sex been different from the one ascribed to them by their employers. The discrimination they experienced was therefore "because of * * * sex."Failure to recognize these forms of discrimination would leave unchecked a significant and pervasive source of workplace discrimination, affecting a broad swath of individuals with minority sexual orientation or transgender status. More than 4% of the American workforce self-identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT), and numerous studies have highlighted the severe economic disparities and workplace instability faced by LGBT persons.5 Indeed, data collected by Gallup Inc. suggests that LGBT persons have significantly higher unemployment rates, 9%, than nonLGBT persons, 5%. The consequences borne from these discriminatory workplace disadvantages abridge LGBT persons' ability to participate fully in the larger economy and represent a deprivation of LGBT persons' entitlement under Title VII to equal treatment in employment.5 See, e.g., Sandy E. James et al., 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey 11, 12, 14 (2016), http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/ files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF.1
