I. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PERSONS BECAUSE OF THEIR MINORITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR TRANSGENDER STATUS OCCURS BECAUSE OF SEX AND VIOLATES TITLE VIIAs this Court has observed, Congress enacted Title VII for the plainly prophylactic purposes of achieving "equality of employment opportunities," removing historical barriers, Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 429-430 (1971), and making persons whole for injuries suffered from unlawful employment discrimination, see Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 418 (1975).Consistent with these broad remedial purposes, Title VII's prohibition on discrimination "because of" an individual's sex encompasses three concepts of special relevance here. First, Title VII forbids "treatment of a person in a manner which but for that person's sex would be different." Los Angeles Dep't of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 711 (1978). Second, Title VII precludes employers from evaluating employees on the basis of stereotypes associated with their sex (or ascribed sex) or their perceived non-conformity with gender stereotypes. See id. at 707; accord Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 250-251 (1989) (plurality). Third, Title VII prohibits discrimination based on the interaction of a protected aspect of an employee's identity with the protected aspect of another person with whom the employee associates. See Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty. Coll. of Ind., 853 F.3d 339, 349 (7th Cir. 2017) (en banc) (holding that Title VII prohibits11associational discrimination on the basis of race as well as color, national origin, religion, and sex); cf. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1967) (finding that associational discrimination violates the Equal Protection Clause).Sexual orientation and transgender status discrimination constitute classic forms of sex discrimination under the first two pillars of Title VII's protections, and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation equally qualifies as associational discrimination.A. Sexual Orientation And Transgender Status Discrimination Only Occur "Because Of" The Individual's "Sex"Title VII prohibits, in straightforward fashion, discrimination "because of * * * sex." 42 U.S.C. 2000e2(a)(1)-(2). Interpreting this plain language, this Court adopted a "simple test" for determining whether an employment practice constitutes sex discrimination: "whether the evidence shows treatment of a person in a manner which but for the person's sex would be different." Manhart, 435 U.S. at 711 (emphasis added)."When the words of a statute are unambiguous, * * * [the] `judicial inquiry is complete.' " Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 462 (2002). The Court's inquiry should "begin and end" with Title VII's unambiguous text. Star Athletica v. Varsity Brands, 137 S. Ct. 1002, 1010 (2017). The Court has repeatedly emphasized "the basic and unexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the clear meaning of statutes as written," Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U.S. 469, 476 (1992), and eschewed interpretations that12stray from the statutory text, see, e.g., Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 334 (2010) ("We cannot replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress' intent.").Title VII's express text controls the resolution of these cases. Adherence to Title VII's "because of * * * sex" language supports only one conclusion--that Title VII encompasses discrimination because of the sex of the employee whose sexual orientation or transgender status does not conform to the employer's sex-based stereotypes.Sexual orientation discrimination inherently involves sex-based differentiation. The employee's sex constitutes an essential--but for--element of the discrimination itself, because identifying an individual's sexual orientation requires two key considerations: the individual's sex and the sex of the individual's partners. Therefore, sexual orientation fundamentally constitutes a function of sex--both in terms of the employee's sex and the employee's sexual attraction to individuals of the same sex. See Hively, 853 F.3d at 350 ("It would require considerable calisthenics to remove the `sex' from `sexual orientation.' ").Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation thus easily satisfies the Court's "but for" test for determining whether an employment practice constitutes sex discrimination. Manhart, 435 U.S. at 711. In the context of sexual orientation discrimination, the employee's sex plainly provides the impetus, at least in part, for the differential treatment. For example, a male employee terminated because of his sexual attrac-13tion to, or relationship with, another male would not have been terminated if he had been a woman attracted to, or in a relationship with, the same male partner-- and that differential treatment only occurs because of (and would not have occurred "but for") the male employee's sex. Under the Court's own inquiry, sexual orientation discrimination qualifies as "paradigmatic sex discrimination." Hively, 853 F.3d at 345 (describing the same sort of hypothetical as "paradigmatic sex discrimination").Analogously, an employer cannot fire an employee on the basis of transgender status without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee's sex. Transgender status discrimination, like discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, presents a classic form of sex discrimination because the employee's sex assigned at birth, as opposed to the sex to which the employee identifies, necessarily affects the employment decision.An employer that refuses to hire a transgender woman because of her gender transition subjects the woman to differential treatment because of the sex the employer ascribes to the employee. Therefore, transgender status discrimination necessarily entails treatment that would have been different "but for" the employee's sex. See EEOC v. R.G. &. G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc., 884 F.3d 560, 575 (6th Cir. 2018) ("[I]t is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee's status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee's sex."), cert. granted, 139 S. Ct. 1599 (2019).14These "simple" conclusions remain true, regardless of whether Congress' precise intent at the time of Title VII's enactment encompassed discrimination against persons because of their minority sexual orientation or transgender status. As this Court has explained, Title VII's protections extend far beyond the "principal evil" envisioned by Congress at the time of enactment. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 79 (1998).The Court has repeatedly declined to construe Title VII's protections in a narrow, parsimonious fashion. The Court has recognized, for example, that sexual harassment, see Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 66-67 (1986), and a "hostile work environment" can violate Title VII, even though those specific practices nowhere "appear in the statutory text," Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 752 (1998). And, in Oncale, this Court found that sex discrimination encompassed same-sex harassment claims, even though recognizing "male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace" "was assuredly not the principal evil" that concerned Congress at enactment. 523 U.S. at 7980. Time and again, the Court has given full effect to the language Congress chose in Title VII. The present cases are as much at the core of Title VII's proscription as those other claims the Court has recognized.The enactment of subsequent legislation that specifically list "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" as prohibited grounds of discrimination does not undermine the plain meaning of the broad language used by Congress in Title VII. To be sure, over thirty years after passage of Title VII, Congress enacted the Hate15Crimes Act, which prohibits violence because of "actual or perceived religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability," 18 U.S.C. 249(a)(2)(A), and amended the Violence Against Women Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of "sexual orientation" and "gender identity," 34 U.S.C. 12291(b)(13)(A). But such belt and suspenders language in later legislation provides little insight into the meaning of the unqualified phrase used in Title VII, "because of * * * sex." The "Constitution puts Congress in the business of writing new laws, not interpreting old ones." United States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. 517, 536 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring). "[L]ater enacted laws * * * do not declare the meaning of earlier law." Ibid.The absence of an amendment to Title VII to include expressly sexual orientation and transgender status similarly "lacks `persuasive significance' because `several equally tenable inferences' may be drawn from such inaction," including the simple understanding that the existing legislation already incorporated the new language. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650 (1990). Simply put, "Congress cannot express its will by a failure to legislate." Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. at 536 (Scalia, J., concurring).The Court should give effect to the words of Title VII, which prohibit adverse employment "because of * * * sex." Each employee in the cases at bar suffered discrimination that would not have occurred but for the employee's sex; Title VII's plain and express language precludes precisely that.16B. Sexual Orientation And Transgender Status Discrimination Necessarily Rest On Sex StereotypesDiscrimination against persons whose sexual orientation or transgender status diverges from the characteristics society ascribes to them on the basis of sex inherently implicates impermissible stereotyping.Beginning in 1978, this Court described the "well recognized" notion that "employment decisions cannot be predicated on mere `stereotyped' impressions about the characteristics of males or females." Manhart, 435 U.S. at 707. As the Court explained, employment decisions cannot be rooted in "[m]yths and purely habitual assumptions," ibid., because "[i]n forbidding employers to discriminate against individuals because of their sex, Congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes," id. at 707 n.13 (citation omitted).In 1989, a plurality of this Court built upon that precedent, by taking Title VII's proscription against discrimination "because of * * * sex" "to mean that gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions." Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 240 (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). According to the plurality, "an employer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she must not be, has acted on the basis of gender," because "we [have moved] beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting that they matched the stereotype associated with their group." Id. at 250-251.17A plurality of this Court, joined by two concurring Justices, therefore concluded that a female employee who faced an adverse employment decision because she failed to "walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry," Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 235 (plurality opinion), stated a claim for sex discrimination under Title VII, even though she did not experience discrimination for being a woman per se, but instead for failing to be womanly enough, see id. at 250252 (plurality opinion); see also id. at 259 (White, J., concurring in the judgment); id. at 272-273 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment).The Court's more recent cases continue to condemn reliance on outdated sex-based stereotypes, albeit in slightly different contexts. Indeed, this Court recently restated its longstanding "suspicion" of laws that rely on "overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females," particularly those reliant on "fixed notions" of gender "roles and abilities." Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. 1678, 1692 (2017). "Laws according or denying benefits" based on "stereotypes" about traditional roles, this Court reasoned, create a "self-fulfilling cycle of discrimination" and prove "stunningly anachronistic." Id. at 1693.Discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and transgender status rests precisely on the sort of "[m]yths," "purely habitual assumptions," and "stunningly anachronistic" stereotyped impressions condemned in Manhart, Price Waterhouse, and Sessions.18Indeed, sexual orientation discrimination rests on a classical gender stereotype--the belief that men should only be attracted to women and that women should only be attracted to men. Under either scenario, the employees in question have rebuffed the stereotypical roles ascribed to their sex, and any adverse employment decision based on the fact that the employee (whether male or female) walks differently, talks differently, dresses differently, or dates or marries a same-sex partner, represents nothing more than a reaction to the individual's sex. Sexual orientation discrimination squarely falls within the purview of Title VII's proscription against sex discrimination. See Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc., 883 F.3d 100, 120-121 (2d Cir. 2018) ("Applying Price Waterhouse's reasoning to sexual orientation, we conclude that when, for example, `an employer * * * acts on the basis of a belief that [men] cannot be [attracted to men], or that [they] must not be,' but takes no such action against women who are attracted to men, the employer `has acted on the basis of gender.' "), cert. granted, 139 S. Ct. 1599 (2019).Discrimination on the basis of transgender status violates these norms in the same way. Indeed, an individual identifies as transgender precisely because his or her behavior transgresses stereotypes of genderappropriate behavior and appearance. But just like a female employee could not be discriminated against based on long-held gender stereotypes (as in Manhart) or for failing to be womanly enough (as in Price Waterhouse), a transgender woman cannot be discriminated against for failing to be manly enough, or, alternatively, for being too feminine. See Ilona M. Turner, Sex Stere-19otyping Per Se: Transgender Employees and Title VII, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 561, 590 (2007) ("If we conceded that Title VII was enacted to protect women from being judged unfairly according to gender stereotypes, we must also agree that Title VII's protections should extend to transgender individuals who are discriminated against because of their perceived violation of gender norms."). In other words, Title VII proscribes discrimination against women for failing to act womanly enough, and against people perceived as men who do. Smith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 574 (6th Cir. 2004).Under any circumstances, this Court plainly recognizes that discrimination on the basis of stereotypical impressions about the characteristics of males or females constitutes sex discrimination, see Manhart, 435 U.S. at 707, and sexual orientation and transgender status discrimination cannot be disentangled from discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes. Consequently, just like the Court's sexual harassment precedent required the conclusion that Title VII includes "sexual harassment of any kind that meets the statutory requirements," Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80, the Court's sex stereotyping precedent compels a holding that Title VII encompasses all forms of sex stereotyping, including those on the grounds that the employee's sexual orientation or transgender status does not conform to the employer's stereotypes for the employee's ascribed sex.For these reasons as well, discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and transgender status neces-20sarily fall within Title VII's proscription against sex discrimination.C. Sexual Orientation Discrimination Constitutes Impermissible Associational DiscriminationFinally, where an employer discriminates based on sexual orientation, the employer's motivation necessarily includes opposition to romantic association between persons of particular sexes.In 1967, this Court recognized that "restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause." Loving, 388 U.S. at 12. In Loving, the Commonwealth of Virginia argued that anti-miscegenation statutes comported with the Equal Protection Clause because such laws applied equally to white and black citizens. See id. at 7-8. But "equal application," this Court reasoned, could not save a statute based "upon distinctions drawn according to race." Id. at 10-11. Accord McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 189-191 (1964) ("Judicial inquiry under the Equal Protection Clause * * * does not end with a showing of equal application among the members of the class defined by the legislation.").The same analysis applies to the protections of Title VII. There is a widespread consensus among the courts of appeals that associational discrimination is a form of discrimination that violates Title VII. See, e.g., Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2008); Tetro v. Elliott Popham Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, & GMC Trucks, Inc., 173 F.3d 988, 994-995 (6th Cir.211999); Deffenbaugh-Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 156 F.3d 581, 589 (5th Cir. 1998), vacated in part on other grounds by Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 182 F.3d 333 (5th Cir. 1999) (en banc); and Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co., 791 F.2d 888, 892 (11th Cir. 1986). Although Loving and many of the aforementioned cases involved associations between persons of different races, many courts have recognized that the principles of associational discrimination apply equally to all of Title VII's protected classifications, including sex. See, e.g., Hively, 853 F.3d at 345; Barrett v. Whirlpool Corp., 556 F.3d 502, 512 (6th Cir. 2009).In Holcomb, a white male sued Iona College, alleging that his former employer terminated him because of his interracial marriage. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that "an employer may violate Title VII if [the employer] takes action against an employee because of the employee's association with a person of another race." 521 F.3d at 138. In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeals emphasized that, where an employee suffers "adverse action because an employer disapproves of interracial association, the employee suffers discrimination" within the ambit of Title VII's proscription against discrimination "because of * * * race." Id. at 139.More recently, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit extended that reasoning to all protected classifications under Title VII. See Hively, 853 F.3d at 347-349. Because the statute "draws no distinction" between discrimination based on race and that based on sex, the court found no basis to limit associational discrimination claims to discrimination because of the em-22ployee's race. Id. at 349. Title VII precludes, without equivocation, adverse employment action "because of [an] individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)-(2). Thus, to the extent Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of the race of an individual with whom the employee associates, Title VII necessarily encompasses discrimination on the basis of the national origin, color, religion, or sex of the employee's associate.In all events, the fundamental crux of the claim remains the same: the plaintiff would not have suffered an adverse employment action if his or her sex, race, color, national origin, or religion had been different. For example, if an employer disapproves of same-sex marriage and terminates a male employee married to a man, the employee suffers associational discrimination based on his own sex (and the sex of those with whom he associates). Discrimination of that form strikes at the heart of Title VII's protections by impermissibly making an employee's sex a motivating factor for an adverse employment action.For these reasons, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation falls within Title VII's proscription against sex discrimination.23II. SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND TRANSGENDER STATUS DISCRIMINATION IMPOSE A CONSIDERABLE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLEDiscrimination against persons because of their minority sexual orientation or transgender status creates profoundly negative consequences that reverberate across all aspects of society, particularly in terms of access to employment opportunities and public accommodations. Indeed, numerous recent studies have quantified the particularly pronounced institutional discrimination experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LBGTQ) Americans. These are precisely the types of societal costs that Congress sought to stamp out through its adoption of Title VII.The extent of discrimination against persons on the basis of their sexual orientation is staggering. According to a recent study published by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, at least one in five LGBTQ people report being personally discriminated against because of their sexuality or transgender status in the contexts of job applications, obtaining equal pay, and consideration for advancement. See Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Discrimination in America: Experiences and Views of LGBTQ Americans (Nov. 2017) (Discrimination in America).That number reflects the fact that in many areas of the country LGBT people have no express protection from discrimination. The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA School of Law has confirmed the consistently greater discrimina-24tion confronted by LGBT people. According to their findings, an estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers live in the United States, and 51% of those workers live in states without explicit statutory protections against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and transgender status. See UCLA School of Law Williams Institute, LGBT People in the U.S. Not Protected by State Nondiscrimination Statutes (Mar. 2019). The reported employment experiences of these individuals readily reflect the absence of such protection--the Williams Institute estimates that nationwide unemployment for LBGT persons rests at 9% (as compared to 5% for non-LGBT people), and that roughly 25% of LGBT people have incomes lower than $24,000 per year (as compared to 18% of non-LGBT people). See Jocelyn Samuels, LGBT workers should be protected from discrimination. Let's hope the Supreme Court agrees, CNN Business (Apr. 24, 2019). In one survey alone, 60% of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people reported being fired from a job or denied employment (as compared to 40% of non-LGB respondents), and 48% of LGB people indicated that they had been denied a promotion or received a negative evaluation (as compared to 32% of Non-LGB respondents). See Ilan H. Meyer, Experiences of Discrimination among Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual People in the US, UCLA School of Law Williams Institute (Apr. 2019).Research related to transgender status discrimination provides an even bleaker depiction of the economic disparities confronted by transgender people. In 2015, the National Center for Transgender Equality reported the unemployment rate of transgender people at 15%--25over three times higher than the national average. See Sandy E. James, et al., The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, National Center for Transgender Equality (Dec. 2016). In addition, the study found that 29% of transgender people live below the poverty line, more than twice the national average. Ibid. And, in one earlier study, 90% of transgender people reported some form of harassment or workplace mistreatment, while 47% of those individuals experienced some form of adverse workplace outcome. See Jerome Hunt, A State-by-State Examination of Nondiscrimination Laws and Policies, Center for American Progress Action Fund (June 2012).6Even those staggering figures paint an incomplete picture, because LGBTQ Americans report significant personal experiences of discrimination in spheres beyond the workplace as well. According to the Harvard study, a majority of all LGBTQ people have personally experienced slurs (57%) or offensive comments (53%) about their sexual orientation or transgender status. See Discrimination in America. Likewise, over half of LGBTQ people report experiencing threats or nonsexual harassment, sexual harassment, or violence, because of their sexual orientation or transgender status,6 The legal profession offers no immunity to these issues. See The Massachusetts Lesbian and Gay Bar Association, The Prevalence of Sexual Orientation Discrimination in the Legal Profession in Massachusetts (Mar. 1994) (explaining that 75% "of lesbian and gay attorneys responding to a [bar] survey have either experienced discrimination based on sexual orientation or heard antigay remarks by colleagues in the office or in court").26and 34% report having been harassed or questioned about their presence in a bathroom. Ibid.The consequences of these far-reaching experiences of discrimination can hardly be overstated. Sexual orientation and transgender status form part of the immutable essence of an individual's being. Discrimination on that basis is destructive both of the individual and to society, especially one built upon the ideal of equal protection under the laws.CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed, and the judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Sixth Circuits should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER ROBERT M.
