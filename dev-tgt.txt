This Court should review the Eighth Circuit's en banc decision for two reasons:First, the impact of White is uncertain. Judicial elections and the state codes modeled on the ABA canons will be in limbo without guidance from this Court. Issues concerning fundraising and political activities in judicial campaigns are likely to recur unless the Court intervenes.Second, the proper scope of campaign regulations affecting judicial candidates and judges is important to the ABA and the public. The ABA's Model Code must both advance the goals of judicial independence, integrity, and impartiality and comport with this Court's guidance
